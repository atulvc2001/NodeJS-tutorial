# Node.js and Express.js Project

This project is based on the tutorials provided by John Smilga on YouTube, focused on learning and practicing Node.js and Express.js for web development. It covers the basics of setting up a server, handling routes, middleware, templates, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git `

2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
`npm install`

3. Start the server by running the following command:
`npm start`

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Features

- **Express.js Server**: The project utilizes Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, to handle HTTP requests and responses.

- **Routing**: Different routes are defined to handle various endpoints of the application, such as handling GET and POST requests for rendering pages or processing form submissions.

- **Middleware**: Middleware functions are used to execute code at various stages of the request-response cycle, allowing for tasks such as logging, authentication, and error handling.

- **Template Engine**: The project incorporates a template engine (such as EJS or Pug) to dynamically generate HTML content based on data from the server.

## Dependencies

- express: ^4.17.1
- nodemon: ^2.0.15 (devDependency)
